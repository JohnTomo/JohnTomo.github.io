<p>Having three shoulder surgeries allowed aspiring Blue Jays catcher Max Pentecost time for reflection. "I was able to get a grasp on how my body works and reacts. It's helped me get to where I am now." The 11th overall draft pick in 2014 is expected to open this season with double-A New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Drafted 11th overall in 2014, he has undergone three shoulder surgeries but it's given Pentecost a lot of time to reflect and learn about himself.

"I was able to look back and watch the game from a different perspective as opposed to being in it. At the same time, I was able to get a grasp on how my body works and reacts," Pentecost told CBC Sports at the Blue Jays' annual rookie orientation camp last January. "It's helped me get to where I am now."

The Winder, Ga., native will likely begin the season with double-A New Hampshire and has split time as a designated hitter and catcher at this year's big league spring training.</p>
